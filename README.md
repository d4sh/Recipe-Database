Run the server from where app.js is located (node app.js)

What to expect:
1) Standard cases - you can view a file, then make changes, then update it (persistent).
2) Other cases -
	a) First run: You try to update without viewing, you will get a warning.
	b) Viewing one recipe ("Banana Pancakes") then selecting (but not clicking view) another recipe 
	   in the dropdown ("Ratatouille") then pressing update will give you a warning.
